	<p>Decrypto is a communication game of game designers Thomas Dagenais-Lesperance , which in 2018 in the Canadian game publisher Le Scorpion Masqu√© appeared internationally at various publishing houses in English, German and French, and shortly thereafter. In the game, two teams play against each other and the aim is to send your team partners encrypted codes that the opponents must not intercept.</p>
	<p>In the game, two groups play against each other, whereby the individual team members each try to transmit encrypted codes to their teammates without them being intercepted by the opposing team. They also try to intercept messages from their opponents themselves.<br>In addition to the game instructions, the game material consists of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>110 double-sided key word cards with messages to be transmitted</li>
		<li>2 screens with 4 decryption windows each,</li>
		<li>two sets with 24 code cards each in black and white,</li>
		<li>4 interception markers and 4 misunderstanding markers,</li>
		<li>an hourglass, and</li>
		<li>a pad of 50 notepads.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Preperation</h2>
	<p>Before the game, two teams of two to four players each form. The respective teams sit down at one side of the table and are given a viewing screen, which they set up in front of them, and a note sheet on which they can write down notes later. In addition, both teams receive 4 key cards each, which are inserted into the windows of the viewing screen. In addition, each team receives one of the code card sets, which is shuffled and placed face down in front of the team. The interception and misunderstanding markers are placed in the middle of the table with the hourglass.</p>

		<h2>Order of the game rounds</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Determine the encryptor</li>
			<li>Draw code cards</li>
			<li>Write down the notes</li>
			<li>Read out hints, note down oposing hints</li>
			<li>Resolve code</li>
			<li>Distribute marker</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>Each round of the game begins with the team's encryptors pulling a code card with a three-digit code from their deck of cards and keeping it secret from their fellow players. The two encryptors now write their instructions in the corresponding fields on the notes, using the respective instructions on the key cards. As soon as an encryptor has noted his clues, he turns the hourglass and the opposing encryptor then has 30 seconds to write down his terms.</p>
	<p>If the opposing team has guessed the code correctly, it receives an interception marker, if the code is incorrect, nothing happens. If the cipher team has guessed the wrong code, it receives a misunderstanding marker, if the code is correct, nothing happens. The correct code is noted next to the assumption and the information can be assigned to the respective digits. The code card is then returned to the deck of cards that is shuffled.<p>

	<h2>End of game</h2>
	<p>The game ends after the round in which a team either has two interception markers and thus wins the game, or if a team has two misunderstanding markers and thus loses the game. Alternatively, the game ends after the eighth round if neither team has received two identical markers by then. In the event of a tie, i.e. if one team has two interception markers and two misunderstanding markers, or both teams have two markers of the same type, the winner is determined from the sum of the interception markers available minus the sum of the misunderstanding markers. If there is still a tie after that, the teams try to guess the code words of the other team and the team with the most correct answers wins.<p>
